# Auth Phone

## Short Description
A lightweight, secure phone-based authentication system for verifying user identity through SMS or voice calls.

## Overview
Auth Phone provides a robust solution for implementing phone-based authentication in web and mobile applications. It offers a simple API for sending verification codes, validating phone numbers, and implementing two-factor authentication flows. The library focuses on security, reliability, and ease of integration across multiple platforms.

## Features
- SMS and voice call verification methods
- Customizable code formats and expiration times
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- International phone number support
- Comprehensive logging and analytics
- Easy integration with popular authentication frameworks

## Installation

```bash
npm install auth-phone
# or
yarn add auth-phone
```

## Quick Start

```javascript
const AuthPhone = require('auth-phone');

const auth = new AuthPhone({
  apiKey: 'your-api-key',
  // additional configuration options
});

// Send verification code
auth.sendVerificationCode('+15551234567')
  .then(result => console.log('Verification sent:', result))
  .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));

// Verify code
auth.verifyCode('+15551234567', '123456')
  .then(isValid => {
    if (isValid) {
      console.log('Successfully verified!');
    } else {
      console.log('Invalid code');
    }
  });
```

## Configuration Options

| Option | Type | Description | Default |
|--------|------|-------------|---------|
| `apiKey` | string | Your API key | required |
| `codeLength` | number | Length of verification code | 6 |
| `codeExpiration` | number | Expiration time in seconds | 300 |
| `maxAttempts` | number | Max verification attempts | 3 |

## Security Considerations
- All SMS and voice communications are encrypted
- Verification codes are hashed in the database
- Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks
- Detailed audit logs for security monitoring
